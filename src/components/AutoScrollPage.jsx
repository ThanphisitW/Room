        The resting youth are not failures, nor are they lost causes.
        They are a generation caught between ambition and exhaustion
        young people who stepped away not because they lacked will,
        but because they could no longer keep running toward a finish line that kept disappearing.
        They are thoughtful, sensitive, and weary, not idle.
        Behind their pause is not laziness, but quiet resistance
        not despair, but a fragile hope that the world might someday meet them halfway.
        To understand them is not to fix them
        it is simply to see them, and let them breathe.
